        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Stevenson's Academy is an academic institution centered on the holistic building and transformation of a child.</p>
        <p>Stevenson's Academy is built upon the rock which is Jesus Christ Of Nazareth. We don't only focus on the academics wellbeing and success of ur ward, but also on the success of ur ward as it relates to eternity, because we believe that no child is complete without Christ in his/her Life.</p>
        <p>The possibility of ur ward discovering his purpose and gift's on planet earth is at a degree of intimacy and surrendering he or she has given to Jesus Christ;"No man can discover himself without the help of the one who made him"</p>
